## Assignment 1: NumPy & Pandas Fundamentals

**File:** `assignment1_Q.1_numpy.py` & `assignment1_Q.2_videogames.py`

### Topics Covered
- NumPy array creation and manipulation
- Statistical operations
- Boolean masking
- Custom spiral traversal of a matrix
- Data analysis using Pandas
- Data visualization using Matplotlib

### Tasks Implemented
1. Created a 5×5 NumPy array with random integers
2. Extracted the middle element
3. Computed the mean of each row
4. Identified elements greater than the overall mean
5. Implemented a function to print elements in spiral order
6. Analyzed a video game sales dataset:
   - Computed global sales
   - Sorted games by total sales
   - Aggregated sales by genre
   - Visualized genre-wise sales
   - Filtered and analyzed *Grand Theft Auto* titles
   - Created a regional sales pie chart

## Assignment 2: Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning

**File:** `assignment2_spotify_ml.py`

### Topics Covered
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling (Standardization)
- Data visualization (Seaborn & Matplotlib)
- Supervised machine learning
- Model evaluation

### Tasks Implemented
1. Initial dataset inspection (shape, columns, info, statistics)
2. Identification of numerical and categorical features
3. Handling missing values in key audio features
4. Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
5. Visualizations:
   - Histograms
   - Boxplots
   - Scatter plots
   - Correlation heatmap
6. Created a binary **mood** label using valence
7. Trained and evaluated:
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Decision Tree Classifier
8. Compared models using:
   - Classification reports
   - Confusion matrices

### Key Findings
- Logistic Regression provided the most balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1-score.
- KNN performed competitively but is sensitive to parameter selection.
- Decision Trees were interpretable but showed signs of overfitting at higher depths.

## Dataset
- `dataset.csv` contains the audio features dataset used for EDA and machine learning.
- Sales data in Assignment 1 is loaded directly from the given source in `assignment1_Q.2_videogames.py`

### Assignment 3

It included TODO problems based on week 1 and week 2 resources.

### Problem Statement

Given the audio features of a song, build a machine learning system that can:

1.Classify the mood or genre of a song (Supervised Learning)
2.Identify natural groupings of songs based on audio similarity (Optional)


### Final Assignment

### Level 1: Basic (Compulsory)

🔹 Part A: Data Loading and Understanding

Loaded the Spotify dataset using Pandas

Displayed dataset shape, column names, and data types

Identified numerical and categorical features

🔹 Part B: Probability and Statistics Analysis

Computed:

Mean

Variance

Standard deviation

Analyzed distributions of:

Energy

Danceability

Tempo

Interpreted statistical patterns observed in the dataset

🔹 Part C: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Preprocessing

Checked and handled missing values

Applied feature scaling where required

Visualizations

Feature distribution plots

Correlation heatmap

Feature comparison across genres or moods

These visualizations helped in understanding relationships between audio features.

🔹 Part D: Supervised Learning

Classification Task

Defined a classification problem for mood / genre prediction

Model Training

Split dataset into training and testing sets

Trained the following models:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Model Evaluation

Evaluated models using:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

🔹 Part E: Model Testing on New Song Sample

Selected a song manually

Collected its audio features using a Spotify audio feature viewer

Input the features into the trained model

Predicted the song’s mood or genre

### Results and Observations

Audio features such as energy, danceability, and valence play a significant role in mood classification

Logistic Regression provided a strong baseline performance

KNN offered comparable results depending on feature scaling

Feature correlations helped in understanding musical patterns

### Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained:

Practical experience with real-world datasets

Strong understanding of EDA and feature analysis

Hands-on experience with supervised learning models

Confidence in building and evaluating machine learning pipelines

Interpreted the model output
